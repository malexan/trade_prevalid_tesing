This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
output <- 
  matrix(paste("Content", LETTERS[1:16]), 
         ncol=4, byrow = TRUE)

library(htmlTable)
htmlTable(output,
          header =  paste(c("1st", "2nd",
                            "3rd", "4th"), "header"),
          rnames = paste(c("1st", "2nd",
                           "3rd", "4th"), "row"),
          rgroup = c("Group A",
                     "Group B"),
          n.rgroup = c(2,2),
          cgroup = c("Cgroup 1", "Cgroup 2&dagger;"),
          n.cgroup = c(2,2), 
          caption="Basic table with both column spanners (groups) and row groups",
          tfoot="&dagger; A table footer commment")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
