# Validation of trade data

At prevalidation step we are to make a decision should we accept data from a specific country for the further processing or not. A country could provide data of good quality for one part of commodities and inadequate level of quality for another part. We want to estimate quality differences between commodities of a country.

Quality of data is estimated by following indicators:

* Share per cent of missing quantities
* Share per cent of unit value outliers


### Self-trade

There are cases when a country reports itself as a partner to exports or imports. Such situations can occur due to mistakes or when an entrepÃ´t exists.

```{r examples_of_selftrade}
orange %>% 
  filter(reporter_name == partner_name) %>% 
  group_by(reporter_name, flow) %>% 
  summarize(ntradeflows = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(ntradeflows)) %>% 
  mutate(flow = factor(flow, levels = c(1, 2), 
                       labels = c("Import", "Export"))) %>% 
  rename(Reporter = reporter_name, 
         Flow = flow, 
         Total = ntradeflows) %>% 
  printTab(caption = "Self-trade of commodities from 2nd, 10th and 15th HS chapters in 2011")
```
